# CoffeeScript

CoffeeScript is a little language that compiles into JavaScript.

CoffeeScript is: "It's just JavaScript". The code compiles one-to-one into the equivalent JS, and there is no interpretation at runtime. You can use any existing JavaScript library seamlessly from CoffeeScript (and vice-versa). The compiled output is readable and pretty-printed, will work in every JavaScript runtime, and tends to run as fast or faster than the equivalent handwritten JavaScript.

CoffeeScript compiler is itself written in CoffeeScript, using the Jison parser generator.
